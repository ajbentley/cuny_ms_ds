"7","Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones","PG",0,"A. O. Scott","Star Wars (Movies)","Early and late, in a starship chase sequence and in a light-saber duel between Yoda and the nefarious Count Dooku (Chirstopher Lee), some of the old &quot;Star Wars&quot; magic returns. But otherwise, the mixture of grandeur and whimsy that made the first three movies so thrilling has been sacrificed to self-importance, an incomprehensible plot and some of the worst screen acting of the year. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are dreadful as  Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, who are reunited (and fall in love) in the midst of a messy political crisis that threatens the stability of the republic and the power of the Jedi order. Millions of people will see this dreary, joyless picture, but only those pursuing advanced degrees in &quot;Star Wars&quot;-ology will be able to appreciate it. — A. O.

"8","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace","PG",1,"Janet Maslin","Star Wars: Episode I-the Phantom Menace (Movie)","Stripped of hype and breathless expectations, George Lucas's first installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Mr. Lucas is given free rein. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise was funnier and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this. &#151; Janet Maslin","1999-05-19","1999-05-19","2017-11-02 04:17:57"

"16","Star Trek: Nemesis","PG-13",0,"Stephen Holden","Star Trek: Nemesis (Movie)  ","The &quot;Star Trek&quot; film franchise, now in its 10th episode, is alive and well with all its cornball optimism and intergalactic togetherness  intact. An exploration of heredity versus environment as a determinant of human  behavior, the story finds Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) confronting his younger, evil clone  Shinzon (Tom Hardy), a power-mad dictator who had a horrible childhood working in the  extraterrestrial equivalent of a Siberian salt mine. The story is stretched out too much, but  the climactic showdown features a spectacular collision that is almost worth the wait. -- Stephen Holden

"28","The Chronicles of Riddick","Not Rated",0,"Stephen Holden","Signs of Testosterone Are All Over the Universe","The concentration of synthetic hormones pumping through the vascular system of &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; matches any recent action-adventure movie in the sheer density of steroids per liter of body fluid. In bodybuilding terms, this overmuscled sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is all bulk and no definition. In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by David Twohy, who directed  both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready taglines. Intoned by Vin Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing. Returning from &quot;Pitch  Black,&quot; Mr. Diesel's character, Riddick, a fugitive from a distant planet, pursued across the universe by bounty hunters, might be described as the heavy-metal version of Brad Pitt's Achilles in &quot;Troy.&quot; Here he runs afoul of the Necromongers, an evil race of conquerors. The movie is all about nonstop action, computer generated spectacle and sanitized sadomasochism, edited into one big roaring whir. — Stephen Holden","2004-06-11","2004-06-11","2017-11-02 04:18:03"
"29","Topsy-Turvy","R",1,"Janet Maslin","Topsy-Turvy (Movie)  ","Mike Leigh's grandly entertaining &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as ''Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway. — Janet Maslin","1999-10-02","2000-02-11","2017-11-02 04:17:58"
