You’ve found the right place!BAE Systems is looking for a Research Scientist to join their Special Activity Exploitation (SAX) research group. SAX is part of BAE Systems’ FAST Labs division which is heavily involved in advanced research concepts primarily from the various government research labs and organizations, including DARPA and IARPA. Members of the group are involved in the entire cycle of research development, from the initial concept ideation and program shaping with potential customers and new business pursuits through the execution and transition of research concepts to BAE Systems’ business areas and products. Most programs involve small teams of principal engineers and academically strong assistant researchers. The SAX directorate is a cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research and engineering organization that is the FAST Labs lead for invention and application of innovative machine learning, control, and optimization approaches to learn patterns of behavior from a wide range of data sources, including real-time sensor feeds. Exploitation uses of these behavioral models include anomaly and change detection, prediction of future behavior, and recognition of complex events and activities. Applications of our technology include terrestrial, maritime, and space domains over a range of sensing modalities (e.g., radar, full motion video, radio communication) spanning the technology readiness spectrum from basic research through fielded operational systems. Our cutting edge projects and opportunities advance the frontiers of science as well as contributing to practical systems that solve real problems. We are seeking a highly creative Research Scientist to contribute to the development of advanced algorithms and systems in diverse research areas applying machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, adaptive control, and/or optimization to cutting edge problems such as learning normal behavior patterns of tracked entities (e.g., dismounts, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, satellites, software-defined radios, cyber system users and hosts) to detect anomalous activity or changes in patterns, predict future behavior, or provide advance warning of impending threats to friendly assets. You must be highly motivated, have solid problem-solving abilities, and be willing to perform a wide variety of related tasks.You must be a team player with a proactive attitude and the capacity to be creative and productive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. You must have strong writing and general communication skills, and strong presentation skills are a definite plus. You may participate in meetings with customers, co-contractors, and/or sub-contractors. Some travel may be required to support customer or collaborator meetings, software integration and testing, and/or capability demonstrations.Our ideal Research Scientist is a strong entrepreneur who can develop novel adaptive incremental data-driven model learning and exploitation algorithms, present those ideas to colleagues and customers, write winning proposals, and then execute projects when awarded. You must have a desire to create and/or sustain lines of research by participating in proposal writing and other marketing efforts with research funding agencies such as DARPA.
